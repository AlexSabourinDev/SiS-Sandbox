### How do we work on features?
- Ideally, I would like groups interested in a specific feature to work together. I want to incite cooperation and knowledge sharing.

### How Does Info Sharing Work?
- During "workshop" sessions you can reach out to someone about a concept and discuss it together.
- A focus on documentation is a plus. I want people to be able to communicate what they did, how they did it and what resources they used to allow future coders to take a look at their work and be able to grasp how they did it.
